Pizza Sales Dashboard Project – Power BI & SQL Server

This project showcases an end-to-end Pizza Sales Dashboard built using Power BI as the visualization tool and SQL Server as the backend database for data storage, management, and query processing.

Project Overview :- 

The primary objective is to analyze pizza sales data and present actionable business insights through an interactive dashboard. The entire workflow involves:

Importing and structuring the pizza sales dataset in SQL Server

Creating and optimizing SQL queries for key business questions

Developing a visually compelling and interactive dashboard in Power BI by connecting directly to the SQL Server database

Key Features of the Dashboard :- 

Total Revenue, Pizzas Sold, and Orders: Instantly view major KPIs like revenue (₤817.86K), total pizzas sold (50,000), number of orders (21,000), average order value (₤38.31), and average pizzas per order (2.32).

Sales Trends: Analyze daily and monthly order trends. The dashboard highlights peak order days—Friday and Saturday evenings—as well as high-performing months like July and January.

Best & Worst Sellers: Drill into the top and bottom performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity sold, and total orders. For example, the Thai Chicken Pizza leads in revenue, while the Classic Deluxe Pizza tops quantity and order volume.

Category & Size Analysis: Visualize sales breakdowns by pizza category (Classic, Supreme, Veggie, Chicken) and pizza size (L, M, S, XL, XXL). Large pizzas and the Classic category are top contributors to revenue and sales volume.


Actionable Insights: Key patterns—such as the busiest days and times, bestselling products, and underperforming options—are visually highlighted for strategic decision-making.

How it Works
Data Integration: Sales data, including order details and product attributes, are imported and managed in SQL Server.

Data Analysis with SQL: Complex queries calculate KPIs, segment sales by category/size, and generate trends used by Power BI.

Power BI Dashboard: The visual layer pulls live data using custom SQL queries, delivering performance monitoring and strategic insights via interactive charts, bar graphs, and KPIs.
